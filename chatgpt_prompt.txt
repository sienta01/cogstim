I want to make a card guessing game. Card will show a series of emoji and its respective description in succesion, and then user needs to guess what emoji is shown on the screen. Each answer true will be rewarded a 10 points. After 10 emojis, the score will be shown.

I have set a windows computer for the server. It has python, pip, flask. I'm planning to host the game online with cloudflare tunnel, but for now i'm going to test it offline. 

For this project i need that user can login and save their score time after time (at least for the last 100 entries or so). This project will be a cognitive stimulation project for people with mild cognitive impairment; therefore i need the features that caregivers can review the patient progress.
